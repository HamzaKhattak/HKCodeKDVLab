Adding programs to path while changing the name:
Ie to add fiji to Windows Path or similar for UNIX
Use the trick of adding a .bat file in PATH that leads to it something like fiji.bat with:
###
@echo off
echo.
C:\Users\WORKSTATION\PortPrograms\Fiji.app\ImageJ-win64.exe %*
###
So can have a folder with aliases in some folder in the Path to run things in PowerShell/Command Prompt without actually adding a bunch of stuff to the path




Running command prompt and FIJI code from python, not best way but works
##
#Create video from tif stack using Fiji, could also maybe load into numpy array, but would likely be slower
#os.system('fiji --headless -macro ConvertToVid.ijm)
os.system("ffmpeg -i 1umsv3.mov -c:v libx264 -b:v 2M -maxrate 2M -bufsize 1M output.mp4 ")
###


Use ImageJ code to save a video, need Movie plugin installed on imageJ save as a .ijm file and run using headless
Can use the ImageJ Macro recorder for a bunch of stuff. Doesn't work well in Python mode though and the getArgument command is also broken.

infilepath=args[0];
outfilepath=args[1];
open(infilepath);
run("Movie...", "frame=100 container=.mp4 using=H.264 video=normal save=outfilepath");
close();
